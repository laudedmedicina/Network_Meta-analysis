# Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) Based on Balduzzi et al., 2023

This repository contains the R code for conducting a Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) using the `netmeta` package, as inspired by the methodology outlined in **Balduzzi et al. (2023)**.




## Objective

To perform a network meta-analysis using odds ratios (ORs) for comparing multiple treatments across different studies. The script also generates network graphs, forest plots, rankograms, and league tables, and assesses inconsistency and heterogeneity.



## Required Packages

Make sure the following R packages are installed:

```r
install.packages("netmeta")
install.packages("readxl")
